# Deploy and Backups

- **Deploy to Firebase:** Run `firebase deploy` from the project root after making changes (or when the user asks to deploy). Do not use GitHub to trigger deploy — GitHub is for backups only.
- **Commits:** Commit changes locally with a clear message (and version bump in package.json when applicable).
- **GitHub (backup only):** Push to GitHub only when the user asks to back up / push to GitHub, not to trigger a deploy. Example: when they say "git" or "backup to github" per their rules.

If the user says "deploy" or "deploy to Firebase", run `firebase deploy` (may require Firebase login and can fail on Windows due to symlinks; use WSL or enable Developer Mode if needed).
