# Deploy to Firebase After Changes

When you make changes to this project (bill-lens):

1. **Commit** the changes with a clear message (include version bump in package.json when applicable, per project rule).
2. **Push to origin main** so the "Deploy to Firebase Hosting" workflow runs and the app updates at https://bill-lens.web.app.

Do this yourself in the same session. The user should not have to run deploy or push — only direct you; you handle commit, push, and thus deploy.

Exception: do not commit or push if the user explicitly says to stop, not to deploy, or to leave changes uncommitted.
