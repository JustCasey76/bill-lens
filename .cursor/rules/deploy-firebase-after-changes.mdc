# Deploy to Firebase After Changes

When you make changes to this project (bill-lens):

1. **Commit** the changes with a clear message (include version bump in package.json if applicable, per project rule).
2. **Push to origin main**: `git push origin main`

Do this yourself in the same session; do not ask the user to push or deploy. The GitHub Actions workflow "Deploy to Firebase Hosting" runs on push to main and deploys to https://bill-lens.web.app.

Exception: do not commit or push if the user explicitly says to stop, not to deploy, or to leave changes uncommitted.
